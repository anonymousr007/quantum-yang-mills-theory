# Quantum Yang Mills Theory

## 1. The Physics of Gauge Theory

- Since the early part of the 20th century, it has been understood that the description of nature at the subatomic scale requires quantum mechanics.
- In quantum mechanics, the position and velocity of a particle are noncommuting operators acting on a Hilbert space, and classical notions such as “the trajectory of a particle” do not apply.
- But quantum mechanics of particles is not the whole story.
- In 19th and early 20th century physics, many aspects of nature were described in terms of fields—the electric and magnetic fields that enter in Maxwell’s equations, and the gravitational field governed by Einstein’s equations.
- Since fields interact with particles, it became clear by the late 1920s that an internally coherent account of nature must incorporate quantum concepts for fields as well as for particles.
- After doing this, quantities such as the components of the electric field at different points in space-time become non-commuting operators.
- When one attempts to construct a Hilbert space on which these operators act, one finds many surprises.
- The distinction between fields and particles breaks down, since the Hilbert space of a quantum field is constructed in terms of particle-like excitations.
- Conventional particles, such as electrons, are reinterpreted as states of the quantized field.
- In the process, one finds the prediction of “antimatter”; for every particle, there must be a corresponding antiparticle, with the same mass and opposite electric charge.
- Soon after P.A.M. Dirac predicted this on the basis of quantum field theory, the “positron” or oppositely charged antiparticle of the electron was discovered in cosmic rays.
- The most important Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) for describing elementary particle physics are gauge theories.
- The classical example of a gauge theory is Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. For electromagnetism the gauge symmetry group is the abelian group U(1).
- If A denotes the U(1) gauge connection, locally a one-form on space-time, then the curvature or electromagnetic field tensor is the two-form F = dA, and Maxwell’s equations in the absence of charges and currents read 0 = dF = d ∗ F. 
- Here ∗ denotes the Hodge duality operator; indeed, Hodge introduced his celebrated theory of harmonic forms as a generalization of the solutions to Maxwell’s equations.
- Maxwell’s equations describe large-scale electric and magnetic fields and also—as Maxwell discovered—the propagation of light waves, at a characteristic velocity, the speed of light.
- The idea of a gauge theory evolved from the work of Hermann Weyl. One can find in [34] an interesting discussion of the history of gauge symmetry and the discovery of Yang–Mills theory [50], also known as “non-abelian gauge theory.”
- At the classical level one replaces the gauge group U(1) of electromagnetism by a compact gauge group G.
- The definition of the curvature arising from the connection must be modified to F = dA + A ∧ A, and Maxwell’s equations are replaced by the Yang–Mills equations, 0 = d_AF = d_A ∗ F, where dA is the gauge-covariant extension of the exterior derivative.
- These classical equations can be derived as variational equations from the Yang–Mills Lagrangian

- where Tr denotes an invariant quadratic form on the Lie algebra of G. The Yang–Mills equations are nonlinear—in contrast to the Maxwell equations.
- Like the Einstein equations for the gravitational field, only a few exact solutions of the classical equation are known.
- But the Yang–Mills equations have certain properties in common with the Maxwell equations: In particular they provide the classical description of massless waves that travel at the speed of light.
- By the 1950s, when Yang–Mills theory was discovered, it was already known that the quantum version of Maxwell theory—known as Quantum Electrodynamics or QED—gives an extremely accurate account of electromagnetic fields and forces.
- In fact, QED improved the accuracy for certain earlier quantum theory predictions by several orders of magnitude, as well as predicting new splittings of energy levels.
- So it was natural to inquire whether non-abelian gauge theory described other forces in nature, notably the weak force (responsible among other things for certain forms of radioactivity) and the strong or nuclear force (responsible among other things for the binding of protons and neutrons into nuclei).
- The massless nature of classical Yang–Mills waves was a serious obstacle to applying Yang–Mills theory to the other forces, for the weak and nuclear forces are short range and many of the particles are massive.
- Hence these phenomena did not appear to be associated with long-range fields describing massless particles.
- In the 1960s and 1970s, physicists overcame these obstacles to the physical interpretation of non-abelian gauge theory.
- In the case of the weak force, this was accomplished by the Glashow–Salam–Weinberg electroweak theory [47, 40] with gauge group H = SU(2) × U(1).
- By elaborating the theory with an additional “Higgs field,” one avoided the massless nature of classical Yang–Mills waves.
- The Higgs field transforms in a two-dimensional representation of H; its non-zero and approximately constant value in the vacuum state reduces the structure group from H to a U(1) subgroup (diagonally embedded in SU(2) × U(1)).
- This theory describes both the electromagnetic and weak forces, in a more or less unified way; because of the reduction of the structure group to U(1), the long-range fields are those of electromagnetism only, in accord with what we see in nature.
- The solution to the problem of massless Yang–Mills fields for the strong interactions has a completely different nature.
- That solution did not come from adding fields to Yang–Mills theory, but by discovering a remarkable property of the quantum Yang–Mills theory itself, that is, of the quantum theory whose classical Lagrangian has been given in (1).
- This property is called “asymptotic freedom” [21, 38].
- Roughly this means that at short distances the field displays quantum behavior very similar to its classical behavior; yet at long distances the classical theory is no longer a good guide to the quantum behavior of the field.
- Asymptotic freedom, together with other experimental and theoretical discoveries made in the 1960s and 1970s, made it possible to describe the nuclear force by a non-abelian gauge theory in which the gauge group is G = SU(3).
- The additional fields describe, at the classical level, “quarks,” which are spin 1/2 objects somewhat analogous to the electron, but transforming in the fundamental representation of SU(3).
- The non-abelian gauge theory of the strong force is called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
- The use of QCD to describe the strong force was motivated by a whole series of experimental and theoretical discoveries made in the 1960s and 1970s, involving the symmetries and high-energy behavior of the strong interactions.
- But classical nonabelian gauge theory is very different from the observed world of strong interactions; for QCD to describe the strong force successfully, it must have at the quantum level the following three properties, each of which is dramatically different from the behavior of the classical theory:
  - It must have a “mass gap;” namely there must be some constant ∆ > 0 such that every excitation of the vacuum has energy at least ∆.
  - It must have “quark confinement,” that is, even though the theory is described in terms of elementary fields, such as the quark fields, that transform non-trivially under SU(3), the physical particle states—such as the proton, neutron, and pion—are SU(3)-invariant.
  -  It must have “chiral symmetry breaking,” which means that the vacuum is potentially invariant (in the limit, that the quark-bare masses vanish) only under a certain subgroup of the full symmetry group that acts on the quark fields.
- The first point is necessary to explain why the nuclear force is strong but shortranged; the second is needed to explain why we never see individual quarks; and the third is needed to account for the “current algebra” theory of soft pions that was developed in the 1960s.
- Both experiment—since QCD has numerous successes in confrontation with experiment—and computer simulations, see for example [8], carried out since the late 1970s, have given strong encouragement that QCD does have the properties cited above.
- These properties can be seen, to some extent, in theoretical calculations carried out in a variety of highly oversimplified models (like strongly coupled lattice gauge theory, see, for example, [48]).
- But they are not fully understood theoretically; there does not exist a convincing, whether or not mathematically complete, theoretical computation demonstrating any of the three properties in QCD, as opposed to a severely simplified truncation of it.
