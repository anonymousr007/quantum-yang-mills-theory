# 2. Quest for Mathematical Understanding

- In surveying the physics of gauge theories in the last section, we considered both classical properties—such as the Higgs mechanism for the electroweak theory and quantum properties that do not have classical analogs—like the mass gap and confinement for QCD.
- Classical properties of gauge theory are within the reach of established mathematical methods, and indeed classical non-abelian gauge theory has played a very important role in mathematics in the last twenty years, especially in the study of three- and four-dimensional manifolds.
- On the other hand, one does not yet have a mathematically complete example of a quantum gauge theory in four-dimensional space-time, nor even a precise definition of quantum gauge theory in four dimensions.
- Will this change in the 21st century? We hope so!
- At times, mathematical structures of importance have first appeared in physics before their mathematical importance was fully recognized.
- This happened with the discovery of calculus, which was needed to develop Newtonian mechanics, with functional analysis and group representation theory, topics whose importance became clearer with quantum mechanics, and even with the study of Riemannian geometry, whose development was greatly intensified once it became clear, through Einstein’s invention of General Relativity to describe gravity, that this subject plays a role in the description of nature.
- These areas of mathematics became generally accessible only after a considerable time, over which the ideas were digested, simplified, and integrated into the general mathematical culture.
- Quantum Field Theory (QFT) became increasingly central in physics throughout the 20th century.
- There are reasons to believe that it may be important in 21st century mathematics.
- Indeed, many mathematical subjects that have been actively studied in the last few decades appear to have natural formulations—at least at a heuristic level—in terms of QFT.
- New structures spanning probability, analysis, algebra, and geometry have emerged, for which a general mathematical framework is still in its infancy.
- On the analytic side, a byproduct of the existence proofs and mathematical construction of certain quantum field theories was the construction of new sorts of measures, in particular non-Gaussian, Euclidean-invariant measures on spaces of generalized functionals. Dirac fields and gauge fields require measures on spaces of functions taking values in a Grassmann algebra and on spaces of functions into other target geometries.
- Renormalization theory arises from the physics of quantum field theory and provides a basis for the mathematical investigation of local singularities (ultraviolet regularity) and of global decay (infra-red regularity) in quantum field theories.
- Asymptotic freedom ensures a decisive regularity in the case when classical Sobolev inequalities are borderline. Surprisingly, the ideas from renormalization theory also apply in other areas of mathematics, including classic work on the convergence of Fourier series and recent progress on classical dynamical systems.
- On the algebraic side, investigations of soluble models of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics have led to many new discoveries involving topics such as Yang–Baxter equations, quantum groups, Bose–Fermi equivalence in two dimensions, and rational conformal field theory.
- Geometry abounds with new mathematical structures rooted in quantum field theory, many of them actively studied in the last twenty years. Examples include Donaldson theory of 4-manifolds, the Jones polynomial of knots and its generalizations, mirror symmetry of complex manifolds, elliptic cohomology, and SL(2,Z) symmetry in the theory of affine Kac–Moody algebras.
- QFT has in certain cases suggested new perspectives on mathematical problems, while in other cases its mathematical value up to the present time is motivational.
- In the case of the geometric examples cited above, a mathematical definition of the relevant QFTs (or one in which the relevant physical techniques can be justified) is not yet at hand.
- Existence theorems that put QFTs on a solid mathematical footing are needed to make the geometrical applications of QFT into a full-fledged part of mathematics.
- Regardless of the future role of QFT in pure mathematics, it is a great challenge for mathematicians to understand the physical principles that have been so important and productive throughout the twentieth century.
- Finally, QFT is the jumping-off point for a quest that may prove central in 21st century physics—the effort to unify gravity and quantum mechanics, perhaps in string theory. 
- For mathematicians to participate in this quest, or even to understand the possible results, QFT must be developed further as a branch of mathematics.
- It is important not only to understand the solution of specific problems arising from physics, but also to set such results within a new mathematical framework.
- One hopes that this framework will provide a unified development of several fields of mathematics and physics, and that it will also provide an arena for the development of new mathematics and physics.
- For these reasons the Scientific Advisory Board of CMI has chosen a Millennium problem about quantum gauge theories.
- Solution of the problem requires both understanding one of the deep unsolved physics mysteries, the existence of a mass gap, and also producing a mathematically complete example of quantum gauge field theory in four-dimensional space-time.
