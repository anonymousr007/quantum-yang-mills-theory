# 3. Quantum Fields

- A quantum field, or local quantum field operator, is an operator-valued generalized function on space-time obeying certain axioms.
- The properties required of the quantum fields are described at a physical level of precision in many textbooks, see, for example, [27].
- G˚arding and Wightman gave mathematically precise axioms for quantum field theories on R^4 with a Minkowski signature, see [45], and Haag and Kastler introduced a related scheme for local functions of the field, see [24].
- Basically, one requires that the Hilbert space H of the quantum field carry a representation of the Poincar´e group (or inhomogeneous Lorentz group).
- The Hamiltonian H and momentum P~ are the self-adjoint elements of the Lie algebra of the group that generate translations in time and space.
- A vacuum vector is an element of H that is invariant under the (representation of the) Poincar´e group.
- One assumes that the representation has positive energy, 0 ≤ H, and a vacuum vector
- Ω ∈ H that is unique up to a phase. Gauge-invariant functions of the quantum fields also act as linear transformations on H and transform covariantly under the Poincar´e group.
- Quantum fields in space-time regions that cannot be connected by a light signal should be independent; G˚arding and Wightman formulate independence as the commuting of the field operators (anti-commuting for two fermionic fields).
- One of the achievements of 20th century axiomatic quantum field theory was the discovery of how to convert a Euclidean-invariant field theory on a Euclidean spacetime to a Lorentz-invariant field theory on Minkowski space-time, and vice-versa.
- Wightman used positive energy to establish analytic continuation of expectations of Minkowski field theories to Euclidean space. Kurt Symanzik interpreted the Euclidean expectations as a statistical mechanical ensemble of classical Markov fields [46], with a probability density proportional to exp(−S), where S denotes the Euclidean action functional.
- E. Nelson reformulated Symanzik’s picture and showed that one can also construct a Hilbert space and a quantum-mechanical field from a Markov field [33].
- Osterwalder and Schrader then discovered the elementary “reflection-positivity” condition to replace the Markov property.
- This gave rise to a general theory establishing equivalence between Lorentzian and Euclidean axiom schemes [35]. See also [13].
- One hopes that the continued mathematical exploration of quantum field theory will lead to refinements of the axiom sets that have been in use up to now, perhaps to incorporate properties considered important by physicists such as the existence of an operator product expansion or of a local stress-energy tensor.
